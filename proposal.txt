CS3201 Project Proposal

#1.Abstract
    This project is to build a program to solve Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using evolutionary algorithm.

#2.Algorithm design
    (1)Representation
        route = a sequence of city IDs    (chromosome)
            e.g. [3, 5, 4, 8, 7, 1, 6, 2, ...]
    (2)Evaluation
        route_length = distance(route) = ∑|cityDist(i,i+1)|
        fitness could be evaluated in three ways
            1.favor and adapt the least one route_length
            2.1 / route_length
            3.e^(1/route_length)
    (3)Crossover
        multi-points cut / uniform cut
        ensure each cities in route appears just once after crossover
    (4)Mutation
        randomly swap two city IDs in route sequence
    (5)Selection
        tournament

#3.Advanced technique
    ...

#4.Runtime optimization
    multithreads when data is considerable large
    store city data in dictionary
    hash table to save data

#5.Organizaion & labour division
