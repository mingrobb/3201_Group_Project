4-layer experiment model
    1. experiment
    2. trials(evolutions)
    3. generations
    4. individuals

    An experiment consists of trial_n trials.
    A trial contains generation_n generations.
    A generation contains population_size individuals.
    An individual stores the essential information of an individual.

    As the trials are very similar to each other, we mainly study the best one trial in an experiment.

GraphingGUI guide
    1. Use the Main_with_GUI.py to generate a specified structured data file for graphing use.
        In the Main_with_GUI.py, after setting up the parameters of the algorithm, the user only needs to set two parameters for graphing.
        They're instance_name and evolution_all, which refer to the source data you are using and how many trials you want to do.
    2. When finished running algorithm, open GraphingGUI.html to view the graphing stuff.
        The manipulation of GUI is quite obvious.
